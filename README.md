# Facilitator Lead Project: Kes-Ke-Say

Facilitators lead us in projects towards the end of bootcamp, allowed for some slightly longer projects, more teamwork and planning involved. Was a great switch of pace.
- [ ] We were buddied up in 2's and 3's to work on specific parts of the project.
- [ ] Allowed for a more real life scenario for web development.
- [ ] Lots of communication, pair programming, and some dividing to conquer in my pair.
- [ ] Wrote more tests in this project than any others, got to about 85% test coverage which was actually really interesting. Sparked a deeper interest in testing.

## Skills
- [ ] Auth
- [ ] React
- [ ] Testing, mostly unit testing, got to a high coverage % on most of the gusy work in a couple of days of almost exclusively writing tests.
- [ ] Teamwork, paired up for the bulk of it.
- [ ] Lots of problem solving as I delved into how testing works
